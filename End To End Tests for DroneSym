1) First get the components to the directory associated with the file by using the Test
  - curl -o- <Link>
  
2) Second, is to set the Values from the "src" to the destination folder. For this go to "gulpfile" and change the root to the destination required.
  
  gulp.task("http-server", function(){
  return connect.server;
  
  root = "<Destination>";
  port = <8.0.8.0>; // change the port according to your server establishment.

  })
  
3) Now, change the "setFile" to the particular destination of the file.

  'Form Test' : function(browser){
  
  .url : <Name(including PortNumber>);
  .waitForElement : (<Display Port>, 1000); // set between the user's handler.
  .setFile(Directory1 = <Destination1>, FileName1 = <Name1>);
  .setFile(Directory2 = <Destination2>, FileName2 = <Name2>); // Do this for multiple files and save the directory location in the "src".
  
4) Now do the test for the server check response.
 
 npm init // Create package json before installing.
 npm install --save-dev<directory>
 > test
 - test.js //file name which has the directory root.
 - testDirectory.js // container which will hold the merged file.
 npm test // Then test for working condition.
 
5) Now to get the fetch process Test.
 
 - npm install express --save // save will add all dependencies to the package.js
 - mkdir test // this will create the new directory in the home directory and use this to store the fetch.
 - fetch express --save<directory> // In place of directory use the test folder created in the home directory.
 
6) Now add the first testing file in the "test" folder created in the home directory.

 - touch test/test-pages.js
 - It will create the following test setup in the test directory.
 
 var expect  = require('chai').expect;
 var request = require('request');
 it('Main page content', function(done) {
    request('http://localhost:8080' , function(error, response, body) { // Give a response that will be fetch by the process.
        expect(body).to.equal('Access Denied'); // Access Denied will be prompt if the user has a low or don't have a connection with the base Port.
        done();
    });
 });
